Q1: In the \(\epsilon\)-greedy action selection algorithm, an agent takes the best-known action ("greedy action") with a probability of \(1 - \epsilon\) and takes a random action with a probability of \(\epsilon\).

### Given:
- Number of actions: 2 (Let's call them \(A\) and \(B\))
- \(\epsilon = 0.5\)

### Calculation:

1. The probability of taking a random action is \(0.5\).
2. Since there are two actions, the random action will be either \(A\) or \(B\) with a probability of \(0.5 \times \frac{1}{2} = 0.25\) for each action.

The total probability of taking the greedy action can be calculated as:

\[
\text{Probability of taking greedy action} = (1 - \epsilon) + \left( \epsilon \times \frac{1}{2} \right)
\]

\[
= 0.5 + \left( 0.5 \times \frac{1}{2} \right)
\]

\[
= 0.5 + 0.25
\]

\[
= 0.75
\]
